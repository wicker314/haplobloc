System requirements

Ubuntu 16.04 or higher
packages needed for graphical output: libgd-graph-perl, libgd-perl and libgd-text-perl
which are available from Ubuntu repositories.
the software was tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04


################################################
Intallation guide

the two programs are stand alone perl scripts. No installation is necessary
the programs can be run in the working directory or placed in a dedicated software bin (e.g. /usr/bin).
Typical install time: 10 min

Instructions to run on data



STEP 1: assign SNPs to parental populations 
The software to assign SNPs to parental populations is
NGS_SNPs_from_vcf_test_recent_hybrids

running the program without arguments shows a list of required arguments. 
arguments are supplied without identifiers (e.g. -o or -i) or wild cards

the input files are:
1. cohort vcf (i.e. variant call file containing genotype info for hypothetical parenta and hybrid populations). The demo file is:
demo_Bgt_maxmiss090_noindels_minDP3maxDP1000_bial_chr09_2MB.recode.vcf

2. list of isolate (individual) names with name of the associated population
the demo file is list_isolates_for_hybrid_test_USA_CHN_JPN

Parameters are:
- minimum info space for parents: minimal number of individuals for which SNP data is available for each SNP (i.e. the inverse of missing data)

- minimum frequency in parent 1: number of individuals of parent 1 population that carry the SNP variant divided by the info space

- minimum frequency in parent 2: number of individuals of parent 2 population that carry the SNP variant divided by the info space

the output file has the prefix "hybrid_plot"
the demo output is hybrid_plot_0.9_0.9__USA_CHN_JPN

Expected run time for demo set: 10 sec
Expected run time for entire 150 Mb genome: 5-10 min

STEP 2:
the graphical representation is done with the perl script
png_hybrid_SNP_plot 
running the program without arguments shows a list of required arguments.
arguments are supplied without identifiers (e.g. -o or -i) or wild cards

Input files are:
1. the hybrid_plot produced in STEP 1.

2. a list with chromosome names and sizes
the demo file is list_Bgt_96224_chr_size

other arguments are:
- y distance between isolates in pixels: determines the size of the lines by which the SNPs are displayed
- query for hybrid population to display: string that occurs in all individual names that should be displayed. no argument displays all populations.

Expected output: png image (demo set: SNP_plot_hybrid_plot_0.9_0.9__USA_CHN_JPN.png)
Not that the demo set only contains data for the first 2 Mb of chromosome 9.
Expected run time for demo set: 5 sec
Expected run time for entire 150 Mb genome: 50 sec
